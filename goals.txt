Goals:
- Breeding simulator using cute, tiny birds.
- Based on canonical location in story that raises birds in captivity.
- Lots of different variations and colors.
- Inspired by all of the cute varieties of quails.
- Each bird has its own personality.

Tech:
- Likely using python for most tasks because of familiarity.
- Javascript would allow browser embedding but it's slow and doesn't run well here.
- OpenGL is probably the way to go, python has good direct opengl2.0 libraries.
- The presentation will be 2D, with hand-drawn art assets.
- Heavy use of texture compositing to create variations.
- If we have any heavy performance issues, c can be embedded for crucial parts.

GUI Toolkit:
- Custom, non-os-consistent GUI.
- Dead simple, quick to develop, and as few requirements as possible.
- No fancy shit.
- New markup language to lay out.
- No floating elements, focused around anchors.
- Ability to stretch nine-split textures.
- Pixel perfect rendering for other textures.
- Event-driven responses.
- Dedicated to game/custom graphic designs.
- Fully based in python.
