Goals:
- Breeding simulator using cute, tiny birds.
- Based on canonical location in story that raises birds in captivity.
- Lots of different variations and colors.
- Inspired by all of the cute varieties of quails.
- Each bird has its own personality.

Tech:
- Likely using python for most tasks because of familiarity.
- Javascript would allow browser embedding but it's slow and doesn't run well here.
- OpenGL is probably the way to go, python has good direct opengl2.0 libraries.
- The presentation will be 2D, with hand-drawn art assets.
- Heavy use of texture compositing to create variations.
- If we have any heavy performance issues, c can be embedded for crucial parts.
