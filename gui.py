r"""
There are two kinds of gui graphics: things that stretch and things that don't.
Some graphics need to be pixel-perfect to be sharp. So we have to have some sort of
feature that allows very specific pixel dimensions, and not just percentages of the
screen.

...Maybe we shouldn't even worry about this stuff yet. We could just make the screen
a static size and forget about it all until later. It's really kind of an advanced
feature. It's not that important.
