    # when clicked, detect where the click occurred and reference against a table
    # of elements. if the click matches an element, signal that element.
    # so we'll need a table of elements and their locations.
    # if we have a table, we could use that for rendering too.
    # plus then you could edit it externally in a text file or something.
